It can happen the first time we try to publish our calculations in ioChem-BD .

If this message appears: 

![](/general/images/create-publish-error.png)

it is indicating that the user has no communities on the Browse module where to publish to. 

You have to contact your ioChem-BD administrator and request:

  1.  To [generate a community](https://documentation.iochem-bd.org/installation/publishing-endpoints-definition.html) where to publish your calculations (if it doesn't already exists),
  2.  then [add the user](https://documentation.iochem-bd.org/installation/publishing-endpoints-definition.html#assign-community-publishers) to the community as administator.
