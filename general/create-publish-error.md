#### Publication fails with: ' *There has been an error retrieving Browse collection structure...*'

This will usually happen the first time that we try to publish our
calculation in the ioChem-BD system. When this message appears, 

![](/general/images/create-publish-error.png)

it is warning that our user account has no community defined on the Browse module to publish to. You have to contact your ioChem-BD administrator and ask him/her:

1.  To [generate a community](https://documentation.iochem-bd.org/installation/publishing-endpoints-definition.html) where to publish your calculations (if it doesn't already exists),
2.  then [add user](https://documentation.iochem-bd.org/installation/publishing-endpoints-definition.html#assign-community-publishers) to the community as administator.
