The update process of the ioChem-BD platform is quite straighforward by the use of a **shell script utility** build to this effect and deployed with the platform.

Notes:
  * We will consider *IOCHEMBD_HOME* the base path where the software was installed 
  * All operations should be executed by the same linux user that installed and runs the software, unless otherwise advised

###Shutdown the server### 
Update process must be performed with the service stopped.

```bash
iochembd$  cd *IOCHEMBD_HOME* 

```


To be continued ...
